Title: Data Curation Profile
Course: INFX 551
Quarter: Winter 2018
---

### Objectives

- Become familiar with different types of openly available data, documentation, and repositories.
- Gain experience reviewing published data, and its value for reuse.

### Guidelines

**Browse** for datasets in the following contexts. Example repositories are listed below. You are not restricted to repositories on this list.

*Domain / Subject Repositories*
- Inter-university Consortium for Political & Social Research
- National Snow & Ice Data Center
- Dryad  (Links to an external site.)
- TAPAS (TEI Archive, Publishing, and Access Service)

*Institutional repositories*
- DSpace@MIT
- Purdue University Research Repository (PURR)
- Harvard Dataverse

*General Repositories*
- Zenodo
- Figshare

*Open Government Data*
- Comprehensive list at ODS
- Agriculture Department Data Commons

**Select and download** a dataset from an openly accessible repository.
You must be sure that you can open and read the data files and associated documentation. Do not select online databases for this assignment (i.e. You must be able to download the dataset - not simply query an interface).

*Note*: The dataset must have metadata accessible.

**Develop a profile** of one dataset. This will involve downloading, opening, and reading the data files and associated documentation. In order to better understand the content of the dataset and how and why it was published you may need to search for related resources such as project websites, publications, department protocols, etc.

### Deliverable
The report that you turn in (your profile) should include the following elements:

**Overview**: A description (in your own words) of the dataset, the data producers, and the context in which it is currently archived. This can include details about how the data were gathered, who gathered the data, and for what purposes. Think of this as the ‘background’ section to an academic paper. In order to better understand the content of the dataset and how and why it was published you may need to search for related resources such as project websites, publications, department protocols, etc.

**Context**: Define the spatial coverage, the temporal coverage, and the applicable topic of the data.

**Methods**: As is possible, reconstruct the methods that were used to produce this dataset. For example, if this is survey data, who conducted the survey, how was the survey conducted (telephone, in-person), who was surveyed, etc. Some categories to include:
- Subjects
- Sampling strategy
- Quality Control / Data Processing
- Constraints (e.g. missing values, limitations of the study, etc)
- Privacy
- Ethics (e.g. did the study require IRB approval?)

**Data Dictionary**: Create a data dictionary that records the names of the variables, any constraints on the values for those variables, and a definition of each variable.

**Reuse Potential**: Who might use this data, for what purposes, what are limitations or potential barriers to reuse?

**Curation needs**: What curation would be required for the dataset to be meaningfully reused? Describe any of the fields above that could not be competed, and offer a diagnosis as to either why or how this could be remedied.


### Deliverables
- By January 17th you should select a dataset, and make a post to the discussion forum that provides a link, and brief discussion of why you have chosen this dataset.
- By January 31st, you should submit your paper (~ 1000 words) and data dictionary. Your narrative may extend beyond the profile guidelines as space allows. Tables or figures are encouraged, but be sure to include explanations of the information presented in them, as needed. Include references to any sources or documentation reviewed, in APA style. References do not count towards word limits.


### Grading Criteria
- Evidence of in-depth examination of the downloaded dataset(s) and supporting documentation.
- Evidence of understanding the repository environment and intended audience.
- Thoughtful discussion of curation needs and services.
- Well formed Data Dictionary
- Overall quality of analysis and completeness of profile.
