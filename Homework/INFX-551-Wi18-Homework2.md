Your data dictionary should include five elements:
1. Variable - In plain language (e.g. Gross National Product) (note you may have to guess- this is fine)
2. Variable label (as they appear in the dataset you select - e.g. GNP)
3. Measurement Units (if applicable)
4. Allowed Values (this could include the Type of value (e.g. string, dataTime) or the Control on that Value (e.g. Postal Codes from the USPS)
5. Description (of the variable and values).

Your submission should take the form of a table (e.g. a Word document or a markdown document that has a table with the five elements included).
