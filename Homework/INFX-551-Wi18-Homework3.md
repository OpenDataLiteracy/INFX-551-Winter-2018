This week in class we will get a demo of the "Data Management Planing" tool (DMP)

For homework this week we are going to reverse engineer a data management plan using the DMP tool.

Steps to complete the homework are as follows:

1. Launch the DMPTool website: http://dmptool.org. Familiarize yourself with its contents.
2. Explore the resources and materials on the site, especially:
- General data management guidance: http://dmptool.org/dm_guidance
- Quick start guide for creating a DMP: http://dmptool.org/quickstartguide
3. Log in to the DMPTool. You can do this using your UW account information.
4. Create a new data management plan for the dataset that you used for your Data Profile assignment. Follow the instructions on the Quick Start Guide. You should select a funder such as "National Science Foundation" or "Sloan Foundation" that is relevant to your dataset. If you aren't sure feel free to ask.
5. Fill out the various sections using the guidance and help text provided within the tool (in places you will absolutely have to guess how the data producers created this data. THAT IS OK- the point is to walk through each step thinking about how the data were planned to be managed).
6. Once you have finished your DMP, export it as a PDF and submit to this assignment page.
7. The homework will be graded solely on complete or not complete. Just give this an earnest effort to try to understand the value of using a DMP tool.
